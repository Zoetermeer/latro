There are *types* and *interfaces*.  An interface is analogous to a
typeclass in Haskell.

With the examples as written, there are two kinds of types:

  - Data types (scalars, ADT's, structures)
  - Module types

Both kinds of types can have functions/behaviors associated with them
via post-hoc definitions, and both can also implement any number
of interfaces.
